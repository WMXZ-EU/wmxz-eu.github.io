    "The minus sign in equation is simply due to the convention that positive azimuth is measured towards starboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the elevation angle $\\beta$ is restricted to ±90°, an ordinary inverse sinus is sufficient but a four-quadrant inverse tangent seems also here preferred because it is insensitive to a common factor (e.g. uncertain sound speed at the array).\n",

    "To obtain an optimal volumetric array the hydrophones are located on the tips of an tetrahedron. This way all 6 hydrophone pairs have the same sepatation.\n",
    "While direction finding could be done with only 3 hydrophone pairs, the use of all 6 different combinations should improve the performance, as the impact of measurement errors is reduced. \n",
    "This is reflected by the Least-Mean-Square notation in equation. \n",
    "Also, using all possible hydrophone pairs puts the reference location of the array automatically in the center of the array eliminating the need for a selection of a reference hydrophone.\n",
