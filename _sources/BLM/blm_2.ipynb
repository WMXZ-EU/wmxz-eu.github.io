    "#### Newton' law of motion:\n",
    "Newton: \"a change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along a stright line in which the force is impressed\"\n",

    "In mathematical terms\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "m\\frac{d}{dt}(u)=F_u\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $m$ is the particle mass that is considered constant and $u$ is the velocity of the particles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restoring force of pressure gradient:\n",
    "If a (spherical) particle volume is forefully changed by external pressure then the restoring force is proportional to the pressure variation\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_p = - \\frac{d}{dr} P\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $V=m\\rho$ is the (spherical) volume of the particles  and $r$ is measured along the radial dimension of the spherical volume.\n",

    "Relative changes in particle densities is compensated by a velocity gradient\n",

    "Combining all three equations one can obtain the wave equation that is the mathematical desctiption of propagating waves and disturbances\n",

    "rP = f(ct \\pm r)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This can easily be verified by the second derivatives with respect to time $t$ and range $r$. The form of the solution $f(ct \\pm r)$ is an indication that the time evolution of waves is directly related with spatial distribution of the wave. \n",

    "The solution to the spherical wave equation contains as argument $(ct \\pm r)$ which means that for any solution we have two cases \n",
